<p>For tens of years; surface logging was stuck on a level of collecting geological samples and monitoring mud pits with no real participation in decision making in well life cycle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mud Logging <br>
<ul><li>Description of rock samples</li>
<li>Hydrocarbon gas detection</li>
<li>Drilling efficiency and safety monitoring</li>
<li>kick detection</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Recently new concepts and services were introduced to oil industry under the term Advanced Surface Logging where surface logging operators are part of the decision making and improvement during drilling a well.</p>

<p>As the target during drilling is to hit the sweet spot with lower cost, and this could be reached with better resolution of drilled formation and chosen reservoir in parallel to faster drilling and avoid hazards those could cause losses in money, time, and unfortunately sometimes lives.</p>

<p>Weatherford and other leading companies in oil services providers market, started to push research and development in the direction of covering above points, some of many additional services are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Gas Detection <br>
<ul><li>Quantitative composition</li>
<li>GC-TRACER™</li>
<li>Mass spectrometer</li>
<li>Isotope logging</li></ul></li>
<li>Advanced Cuttings Characterization (Well site Geoscience Services) <br>
<ul><li>X-Ray Fluorescence</li>
<li>X-Ray Diffraction</li>
<li>Source Rock Analyzer</li></ul></li>
<li>Drilling Instrumentation <br>
<ul><li>Electronic drilling recorder</li>
<li>Auto-driller</li></ul></li>
<li>Well-site Consulting <br>
<ul><li>Well site geologists</li>
<li>Pore pressure specialists</li></ul></li>
<li>Real Time Data Services</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to consider how much hydrocarbon evaluation and interpretation is important to clients; a survey was conducted with different clients and result was; gas data is the most important for most of potential clients to surface logging services.</p>

<p>Taking one example of additional services for better gas detection; GC-Tracer  which is a machine designed to extract and analyze gas samples taken from drilling fluid coming out of a well during drilling.</p>

<p>Most of gas extraction methodologies depend on extracting gas from drilling fluid using agitation action which depends on a lot of variables such as drilling fluid rheology and temperature; hence sometimes amount of extracted gas varies for same drilled formation.</p>

<p>With GC-Tracer ; extracting method depends on adsorption concept as the gas is adsorbed from mud on a semi-permeable layer that allows gas to pass to detection machine while liquid is not allowed to pass.</p>

<p>With this technology you’ll avoid all parameters affecting conventional methods of extraction and keep your reading correlated with amount of gas in drilled formation.</p>

<p>Finally, to get why it’s important to measure gas coming from drilled formation, it’s safe to say that you can qualitatively determine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gas/Oil/Water contacts</li>
<li>Oil API and gravity</li>
<li>Condensate zone</li>
<li>Reservoir saturation</li>
<li>Water bearing zone</li>
<li>Geo-steering horizontal formations</li>
</ul></div></body>
